An Agent is composed of a **prompt**, a **custom message**, **tools**, and a **channel**. You must create a prompt and a custom message before you create an Agent. After an Agent is created, you can create a channel for that agent to communicate to your customers through. 

**Prompt:** natural language instructions to the Agent that detail everything your agent does, how it does those things, and what it shouldn’t do. 

* Through the prompt, you also give the Agent access to tools which give it the ability to do useful work like schedule appointments, or relay messages 

* A prompt can be reused by multiple agents

**Tools:** are functions or APIs the Agent can call upon to perform actions like, accessing databases, or manipulate data.

* They let your Agent schedule an appointment on behalf of your customer, or do countless other tasks. 

**Custom message:** messages or responses your Agent says to your callers based on time logic. 

* For example, if your business goes to lunch everyday from 12-1pm, a custom message would instruct the Agent to respond with your desired out to lunch message and behavior.

* Custom messages can be reused by multiple agents.

**Channel:** channels are how your customers will interact with the agent, e.g. web or voice.

* Web is all forms of text through a website, SMS

* Voice can be phone number of internet voice

* To create a channel, you must have an agent already created.&#x20;
