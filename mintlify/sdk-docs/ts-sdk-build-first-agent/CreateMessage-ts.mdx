title: "Create a message"
---

You can create your greeting message using this sample code.

```javascript
import { SyllableSDK } from 'syllable-sdk';

const syllableSDK = new SyllableSDK({
  apiKeyHeader: 'yourkeyhere',
});

const message = await syllableSDK.customMessages.create({
  // The name of the message is used to reference it elsewhere in the system, so you should pick something that’s easily identifiable.
  name: 'Weather greeting',
  // Default text that will be delivered at the beginning of a conversation with an agent using this message.
  text: 'Hello! I\’m a weather agent. I can tell you the current weather in any city, or answer general questions about weather. What would you like to know?',
  // You can also set up a message with time-based rules, so that depending on the timestamp at which the conversation begins, an agent can deliver a different message.
  // We'll skip this for the tutorial, but if you want to know more, check out the docs linked below.
  rules: []
});

console.log(message);
```

**Before you move on, note the ID of the message that you created, as you'll need it later.**

We now have all the required components to create our agent, which we’ll do in the next step. Click “Create an agent” below to continue the tutorial.
