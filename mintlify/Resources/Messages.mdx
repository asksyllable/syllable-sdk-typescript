Messages are configurable text that the [agent](/workspaces/Agents) reads to the user. Every agent must be associated with a message to be delivered as a greeting at the beginning of the conversation. Messages are set up with time-based logic so that the agent can deliver different variations on the message depending on the date and time of the conversation.

### Creating a message

* **Message name**: The name of the message is used to reference it elsewhere in Console, so you should pick something that's easily identifiable.

* **Label (optional)**: Labels are used for filtering messages on the message list screen.

* **Language menu tag button**: This button allows you to insert a language menu tag into the message (see [language groups](/Resources/LanguageGroups))

* **Default message**: Default message to deliver to the user if no conditions are configured (see below), or if the current timestamp does not match any conditions.

* **"Add condition" button**: Messages can be configured using time-based conditions, so that depending on the timing of the conversation, an agent can deliver a different message. If you click the button, a "Message rule" card appears and you can configure your condition.

* **Description**: Information related to the rule, like why it’s used or which agent(s) will use it. 

* **Condition:** Select whether you want the rule to take effect when the time/date IS a certain value, or when it’s NOT a certain value. 

* **Time type:** Select whether the messages should follow rules based on the day of the week, like for a Friday closure, or specific date(s), like a holiday. 

* **Time range:** Indicate whether the message should follow a specific time of day.

* **All day:** Check this box if the rule should apply all day for the selected days.

* **Language menu tag button**: This button allows you to insert a language menu tag into the message (see [language groups](/Resources/LanguageGroups))

* **Message**: Write out the specific message the agent will say based on the logic you just defined. 

If multiple rules match the current time, the system will use the most specific one (i.e., the one that matches the shortest time range). The order of rules to check is as follows:

1. Rules that match a specific date

2. Rules that match day(s) of the week

3. Rules with a NOT match on a specific date
