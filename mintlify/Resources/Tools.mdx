Tools are functions or APIs the Agent can call upon to perform actions like, accessing databases, or manipulate data.They let your Agent schedule an appointment on behalf of your customer, or do countless other tasks. 

The tools list page shows all of the tools currently available to your organization. 

If you want an Agent to reference a specific tool during sessions with customers, then you need to provide those instructions in the prompt.
