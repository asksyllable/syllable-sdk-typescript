**Syllableâ€™s AI agents are custom built to your business.** Built on top of large language models (LLMs), an agent receives its instructions and behavior from a prompt. Prompts have access to tools, which allow agents to perform tasks by interacting with data sources and APIs. Your users interact and converse with agents through channels like web chat or voice.

**Syllable makes it effortless to build and deploy voice agents.** There are two ways to create agents: the [Syllable Console UI](https://beta.syllable.cloud/), and the [<u>SDK</u>](https://docs.syllable.ai/sdk-docs/Overview#syllable-sdk), which is currently available in TypeScript and Python. Regardless of which path you choose, the principles outlined in this guide will help you get started.
