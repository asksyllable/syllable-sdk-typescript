**Syllable’s AI Agents are custom built to your business.** Built on top of large language models (LLM), an agent receives its instructions and behavior from a prompt. Prompts have access to tools, which allow Agents to perform tasks by interacting with Data Sources and API’s. Your Users interact and converse with Agents through channels like web chat or voice. Some channels may require custom greetings.
