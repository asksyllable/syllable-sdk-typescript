The steps to create an Agent on Syllable AI are to first write a prompt, then a custom message, next create a channel, and finally put everything together and configure the Agent.

An Agent is composed of a [**prompt**](https://docs.syllable.ai/Resources/res_WritePrompt), a [**custom message**](https://docs.syllable.ai/Resources/CustomMessages), [**tools**](https://docs.syllable.ai/Resources/Tools), and a [**channel**](https://docs.syllable.ai/Resources/Channels). &#x20;

**Prompt:** natural language instructions to the Agent that detail everything it does, how it does those things, and what it shouldn’t do.&#x20;

* Through the prompt, you also give the Agent access to tools which give it the ability to do useful work like schedule appointments, or relay messages 

* A prompt can be reused by multiple agents.

**Tools:** are functions or APIs the Agent can call upon to perform actions like accessing databases, or manipulate data.

* They let your Agent schedule an appointment on behalf of your customer, or do countless other tasks. 

**Custom message:** messages or responses your Agent says to your callers based on time logic. 

* If your business goes to lunch everyday from 12-1pm, a custom message would instruct the Agent to respond in line with your desired behavior and message.

* Custom messages can be reused by multiple agents.

**Channel:** channels are how your Users will interact with an Agent, e.g. web or voice.

* Web is all forms of text through a website, SMS

* Voice can be phone number or internet voice

* To create a channel, you must have an agent already created.&#x20;
