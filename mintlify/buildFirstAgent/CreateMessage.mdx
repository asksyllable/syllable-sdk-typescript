Messages are configurable text that the agent reads to the user - for example, every agent must be associated with a message to be delivered as a greeting at the beginning of the conversation. Messages are set up with time-based logic so that the agent can deliver different variations on the message depending on the date and time of the conversation.

## Configure a Message

* **Message name:** The name of your message. Use a name that’s easily remembered and specific enough to distinguish it from other message.

* **Label (optional):** A plain text indicator to help you remember your message. It should be different from the name.

* **Text (optional)**: The fallback text that should be delivered if none of the rules match the current timestamp.

### Message rules

These rules let you control when and what your agent will say - for example, if a business is either closed or unavailable for a holiday.

* **Rule description**: Information related to the rule, like why it’s used or which agent(s) will use it. 

* **Condition:** Select whether you want the rule to take effect when the time/date IS a certain value, or when it’s NOT a certain value. 

* **Time type:** Select whether the messages should follow rules based on the day of the week, like for a Friday closure, or specific date(s), like a holiday. 

* **Time range:** Indicate whether the message should follow a specific time of day.

* **\[ ] all day:** Check this box if the rule should apply all day for the selected days.

* **Message**: Write out the specific message the agent will say based on the logic you just defined. 

* **Add condition:** Click the + to add additional rules.

If multiple rules match the current time, the system will use the most specific one (i.e., the one that matches the shortest time range). The order of rules to check is as follows:

1. Rules that match a specific date

2. Rules that match day(s) of the week

3. Rules with a NOT match on a specific date
