This is where you fine tune the details of your Agent by specifying the timezone, which languages it has access to, and its voice if mode is set to voice. Agents must be associated with a prompt and a custom message. You must create these before configuring an Agent.

* **Agent name:** This is just the name of your Agent. Use a name that’s easily remembered and will make it easy to tell the difference between other Agents. 

* **Agent description (optional):** Information related to the Agent, like its purpose or goal. A good rule for description is to include what someone would need to know about this Agent to make sense of it.

* **Prompt:** Select the prompt that contains the instructions for this agent. 

* **Custom message:** A message or response your Agent will say to your callers based on time logic.

* **Label (optional):** This is just a plain text indicator to help you remember your label. It should be different from the name.

* **Timezone:** Select the timezone that your Agent will support.

* **Languages:** Select all of the languages your Agent will be able to communicate in. 

* **Busy sound:** (voice only) Select the sound you want your callers to hear while the Agent is working on the caller’s request. 

* **Voice:** (voice only) Select the voice you want your Agent to speak with.
