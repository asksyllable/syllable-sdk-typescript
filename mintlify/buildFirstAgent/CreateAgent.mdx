This is where you fine tune the details of your agent by specifying the timezone, which languages it has access to, and its voice if mode is set to voice. Agents must be associated with a prompt and a custom message. You must create these before configuring an Agent.

* **Agent name:**&#x54;his is just the name of your agent. Use a name that’s easily remembered and will make it easy to tell the difference between other agents. 

* **Agent description (optional):**&#x49;nformation related to the agent, like its purpose or goal. A good rule for description is to include what someone would need to know about this agent to make sense of it.

* **Prompt:**&#x53;elect the prompt that contains the instructions for this agent. 

* **Custom message:**&#x41; message or response your agent will say to your callers based on time logic.

* **Label (optional):**&#x54;his is just a plaintext indicator to help you remember your label. It should be different from the name.

* **Timezone:**&#x53;elect the timezone that your agent will support.

* **Languages:**&#x53;elect all of the languages in which your agent will be able to communicate. 

* **Busy sound:**(voice mode only) Select the sound you want your callers to hear while the agent is working on the caller’s request. 

* **Voice:**(voice mode only) Select the voice you want your agent to speak with.
