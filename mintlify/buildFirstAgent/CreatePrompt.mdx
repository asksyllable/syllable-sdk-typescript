## Write your prompt

A prompt is a set of written instructions given to an AI Agent that detail everything the Agent does, how it does those things, and what it should and shouldn’t do given certain other conditions. You give the Agent access to tools which give it the ability to do useful work like schedule appointments, or relay messages. A prompt can be reused by multiple agents.

Writing a good prompt for an AI to follow is the same as writing good instructions for a human to follow. It’s essentially a written communication challenge that requires the prompt writer to write clear, unambiguous, and explicit instructions. Writing a good prompt for your use case is an iterative process that requires trial and error writing and testing.
