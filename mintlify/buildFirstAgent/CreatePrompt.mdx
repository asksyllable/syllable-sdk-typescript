## Write your prompt

A prompt is a set of written instructions given to an AI Agent that detail everything the Agent does, how it does those things, and what it should and shouldn’t do given certain other conditions. You give the Agent access to tools which give it the ability to do useful work like schedule appointments, or relay messages. A prompt can be reused by multiple agents.

Writing a good prompt for an AI to follow is the same as writing good instructions for a human to follow. It’s essentially a written communication challenge that requires the prompt writer to write clear, unambiguous, and explicit instructions. Writing a good prompt for your specific use case(s) is an iterative process that requires trial and error writing and testing.

## Configure your prompt

* **Prompt name:** This is just the name of your prompt. Use a name that’s easily remembered and will make it easy to tell the difference between other prompts

* **Description:** Write a short description of the prompt, with what it does, who it’s for, and what its goal is. 

* **Model provider and version**: Depending on the model you use, there may be a specific version you have in mind

* **Select tools from dropdown menu:** Based on the tools available to your organization, you can select tools that give an agent using the prompt the ability to do useful work like schedule appointments or relay messages. (Note: you will have to reference these tools in the prompt in order for the agent to use them.
