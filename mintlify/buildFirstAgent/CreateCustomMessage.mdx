A custom message is a message or response your Agent will say to your callers based on time logic. For example, if your business goes to lunch everyday from 12-1pm, a custom message would instruct the Agent to respond with your desired out to lunch message and behavior. There can be multiple rules for your messages. The message rule hierarchy will follow the order on this page from top to bottom. For example, if you have two rules that take effect on Mondays at 8am, then the rule on top will take precedence.

## Configure a Custom Message

This is to help you and others find the message later, and identify it from other messages.

* **Message name:** This is just the name of your Custom Message. Use a name that’s easily remembered and will make it easy to tell the difference between other Custom Messages

* **Label (optional):** This is just a plain text indicator to help you remember your Custom Message. It should be different from the name.

#### Custom message rules

These rules let you control when and what your Agent will say,  for example, if a business is either closed or unavailable for a holiday. 

* **Rule description**: Information related to the rule, like why it’s used or which Agent(s) will use it. 

* **Condition:** Select whether you want the rule to take effect when the time/date IS a certain value, or when it’s NOT a certain value. 

* **Time type:** Select whether the messages should follow rules based on the day of the week, like for a Friday closure, or specific date(s), like a holiday. 

* **Time range:** Indicate whether the custom message should follow a specific time of day

* **\[ ] all day:** Check this box if the rule should apply all day for the selected days.

* **Message**: Write out the specific message the Agent will say based on the logic you just defined. 

* **Add condition:** Click the + to add additional Message rules. A Custom Message will follow the rules based on their order on this page from top to bottom.
