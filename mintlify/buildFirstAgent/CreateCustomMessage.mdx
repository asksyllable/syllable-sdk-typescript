A custom message is a message or response your Agent will say to your callers based on time logic. For example, if your business goes to lunch everyday from 12-1pm, a custom message would instruct the Agent to respond with your desired out to lunch message and behavior. There can be multiple rules for your messages. The message rule hierarchy will follow the order on this page from top to bottom. For example, if you have two rules that take effect on Mondays at 8am, then the rule on top will take precedence.
