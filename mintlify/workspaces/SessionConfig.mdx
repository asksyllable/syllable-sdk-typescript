## Session Variables

A session variable allows you to pass custom variables from agents so that prompts can reference those during conversations (voice or web) with one of your customers. 

* If you have a session variable named agent_name, you can reference it in a prompt like this: 

  `“Hello! My name is {vars.name}! How can I assist you today?”`

* This makes it possible to use the same prompt for multiple agents without having to create a new prompt for each agent.

Certain variables are available to all agents, such as the agent’s voice. These variables are used to configure the agent’s behavior and are set when the agent is created.

* To set the voice used by the agent, set

  `vars.session.voice`

  to the desired voice name. For example, to set the voice to "Alice", set

  `vars.session.voice`

  to

  `elevenlabs:Alice`

* Available Voices

Additionally, if the agent's prompt is linked to any tools that have exposed values to be configurable at the agent level (see [here](https://docs.syllable.ai/Resources/Tools)), you can configure those values here. E.g., if a tool default references "\{vars.hospital\_name}", you can set a value for `vars.hospital_name` in this section, and when the agent calls that tool, it will use the value you've configured for the tool default.

## Tool Headers

This section allows you to set HTTP headers and their values for tool calls made by the agent. Note that headers configured here will be used by the agent for all tools.
