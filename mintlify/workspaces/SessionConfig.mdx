## Session Variables

A session variable allows you to pass custom variables from agents so that prompts can reference those during conversations (voice or web) with one of your customers. 

* If you have a session variable named agent\_name, you can reference it in a prompt like this: “Hello! My name is \{vars.name}! How can I assist you today?” and you can use the same prompt for multiple agents

## Agent Configuration Variables
Certain variables are available to all agents, such as the agent’s name, timezone, and type. These variables are used to configure the agent’s behavior and are set when the agent is created.
* To set the voice used by the agent, set `var.session.voice` to the desired voice name. For example, to set the voice to "Alice", set `var.session.voice` to `elevenlabs:Alice`

## Tool Headers

Tools are configurable on the agent level if agents that are using the same prompt/tool combination need to be able to call different things

* For example, the general information tool uses the “domain” tool header which specifies which website the general information tool should look through to find answers. To do this you should set the domain key and use [<u>www.syllable.ai</u>](http://www.syllable.ai) as the value
