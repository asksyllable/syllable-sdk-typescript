## Session Variables

A session variable allows you to pass custom variables from agents so that prompts can reference those during interactions with one of your customers. In order to make those references you should use \{vars.\[session\_variable]} as a reference in your prompt

* If you have a session variable named agent\_name, you can reference it in a prompt like this: “Hello! My name is \{vars.name}! How can I assist you today?” and you can use the same prompt for multiple agents

## Tool Headers

Tools are configurable on the agent level if agents that are using the same prompt/tool combination need to be able to call different things

* For example, the general information tool uses the “domain” tool header which specifies which website the general information tool should look through to find answers. To do this you should set the domain key and use [<u>www.syllable.ai</u>](http://www.syllable.ai) as the value
