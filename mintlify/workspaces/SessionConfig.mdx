## Session Variables

A session variable allows you to pass custom variables from agents so that prompts can reference those during conversations (voice or web) with one of your customers. 

* If you have a session variable named agent\_name, you can reference it in a prompt like this:`“Hello! My name is {vars.name}! How can I assist you today?”`

* This makes it possible to use the same prompt for multiple agents without having to create a new prompt for each agent.

## Tool Headers

This section allows you to set HTTP headers and their values for tool calls made by the agent. Note that headers configured here will be used by the agent for all tools.
