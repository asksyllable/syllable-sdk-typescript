## Agents List

When you click on Agents on the left navigation bar, you are brought to the Agents List page. This page lists out all of the Agents in your organization. It shows the name of the Agent, when it was last modified and by who, the associated prompt, custom messages, and channel, and any labels attached to that Agent.

From the Agents list page, you can create new Agents by clicking the New Agent button in the top right.Â 

## Agent Configuration

This is where you associate with a prompt, channel, and custom messages. You must create these before configuring an Agent. You can also fine tune the details of your agent by specifying the timezone, which languages it has access to, and its voice (if mode is set to voice).&#x20;

### Session configuration

A session variable allows you to pass custom variables from agents so that prompts can reference those during interactions with one of your customers.
