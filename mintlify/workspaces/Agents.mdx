## Agents List

When you click on Agents on the left navigation bar, you are brought to the Agents List page. This page lists out all of the agents in your organization. It shows the name of the agent, when it was last modified and by who, the associated prompt, custom messages, and channel, and any labels attached to that agent.

From the Agents list page, you can create new agent by clicking the New Agent button in the top right.
