title: "Create a message"
---

You can create your greeting message using this sample code.

```python
from syllable_sdk import CustomMessageCreateRequest, SyllableSDK

sdk = SyllableSDK(
  api_key_header='your_key_here'
)

message = sdk.custom_messages.create(request=CustomMessageCreateRequest(
  # The name of the message is used to reference it elsewhere in the system, so
  # you should pick something that’s easily identifiable.
  name='Weather greeting4',
  # Default text that will be delivered at the beginning of a conversation with
  # an agent using this message.
  text='Hello! I\'m a weather agent. I can tell you the current weather in any city, or answer general questions about weather. What would you like to know?',
  # You can also set up a message with time-based rules, so that depending on
  # the timestamp at which the conversation begins, an agent can deliver a
  # different message. We'll skip this for the tutorial, but if you want to
  # know more, check out the docs linked below.
  rules=[]
))

print(message)
```

**Before you move on, note the ID of the message that you created, as you'll need it later.**

We now have all the required components to create our agent, which we’ll do in the next step. Click “Create an agent” below to continue the tutorial.
