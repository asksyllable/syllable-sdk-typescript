Developer-friendly Python SDK specifically catered to leverage *syllable-sdk* API.

# Syllable Platform SDK

Syllable SDK gives you the power of awesome AI agentry. ðŸš€

The Syllable SDK provides a comprehensive set of tools and APIs to integrate powerful AI capabilities into your communication applications. Whether you're building chatbots, virtual assistants, or any other AI-driven solutions, Syllable SDK has got you covered.

## Features

* **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: Understand and generate human language with ease.

* **LLM Agents**: Leverage pre-built agents or train your own custom agents.

* **Speech Recognition**: Convert speech to text and vice versa.

* **Data Analytics**: Analyze and visualize data to gain insights.

* **Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with other services and platforms.

## SDK Installation

The SDK can be installed using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

```bash
pip install syllable-sdk
```

## API Keys

In order to use the SDK, you'll need a Syllable API key. First, you should [create an account](https://docs.syllable.ai/introsyllable/LoginSignup). Then, after logging into the console, click your user icon in the top right and select "API tokens":

Click "Generate" for the desired organization. Then, copy the API key text from the resulting popup. (After you close the popup you won't be able to see the key again; if you lose it, you'll need to click Revoke to delete the old key, then generate a new one.) You can then use the key in your SDK-consuming code.

## Requirements

For supported Python versions, please consult runtimes doc.

## SDK Example Usage

### Example

```python
from syllable_sdk import SyllableSDK

syllable_sdk = SyllableSDK(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

def run():
    result = syllable_sdk.agents.list()

    # Handle the result
    print(result)

run()
```

## Standalone functions

All the methods listed above are available as standalone functions. These
functions are ideal for use in applications running in the browser, serverless
runtimes or other environments where application bundle size is a primary
concern. When using a bundler to build your application, all unused
functionality will be either excluded from the final bundle or tree-shaken away.

## File uploads

Certain SDK methods accept files as part of a multi-part request. It is possible and typically recommended to upload files as a stream rather than reading the entire contents into memory. This avoids excessive memory consumption and potentially crashing with out-of-memory errors when working with very large files. The following example demonstrates how to attach a file stream to a request.

```python
from syllable_sdk import SyllableSDK

syllable_sdk = SyllableSDK(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

def run():
    with open("example.file", "rb") as file:
        result = syllable_sdk.v1.directory_member_bulk_load(file=file)

    # Handle the result
    print(result)

run()

```

## Retries

Some of the endpoints in this SDK support retries.  If you use the SDK without any configuration, it will fall back to the default retry strategy provided by the API.  However, the default retry strategy can be overridden on a per-operation basis, or across the entire SDK.

To change the default retry strategy for a single API call, simply provide a retry_config object to the call:

```python
from syllable_sdk import SyllableSDK

syllable_sdk = SyllableSDK(api_key_header="YOUR_API_KEY")

def run():
    result = syllable_sdk.agents.list(
        retries={
            "strategy": "backoff",
            "backoff": {
                "initial_interval": 1,
                "max_interval": 50,
                "exponent": 1.1,
                "max_elapsed_time": 100,
            },
            "retry_connection_errors": False,
        }
    )

    # Handle the result
    print(result)

run()

```

To override the default retry strategy for all operations, you can provide a retry_config at SDK initialization:
```python
from syllable_sdk import SyllableSDK

syllable_sdk = SyllableSDK(
    api_key_header="YOUR_API_KEY",
    retry_config={
            "strategy": "backoff",
            "backoff": {
                "initial_interval": 1,
                "max_interval": 50,
                "exponent": 1.1,
                "max_elapsed_time": 100,
            },
            "retry_connection_errors": False,
        }
)

def run():
    result = syllable_sdk.agents.list()

    # Handle the result
    print(result)

run()

```

## Error Handling

Some methods specify known errors which can be raised. All the known errors are enumerated in the syllable_sdk.errors module. For example, the list method may raise the following errors:
| Error Type                 | Status Code | Content Type     |
| -------------------------- | ----------- | ---------------- |
| models.HTTPValidationError        | 422         | application/json |
| models.APIError                    | 4XX, 5XX    | \*/\*            |

If the method raises an error and it is not captured by the known errors, it will default to raising an SDKError.

```python
from syllable_sdk import SyllableSDK
from syllable_sdk.models import HTTPValidationError, APIError

syllable_sdk = SyllableSDK(api_key_header="YOUR_API_KEY")

def run():
    try:
        result = syllable_sdk.agents.list()

        # Handle the result
        print(result)
    except APIError as err:
        # Handle SDK validation errors
        print(err.message)
    except HTTPValidationError as err:
        # Handle HTTP validation errors
        print(err)
    except Exception as err:
        # Handle other errors
        raise err

run()

```

Validation errors can also occur when either method arguments or data returned from the server do not match the expected format. The `APIError` that is thrown as a result will capture the raw value that failed validation in an attribute called `raw_response`. 

## Server Selection

### Select Server by Index

You can override the default server globally by passing a server index to the `server_idx` optional parameter when initializing the SDK client instance. The selected server will then be used as the default on the operations that use it. This table lists the indexes associated with the available servers:

| # | Server                       |
| - | ---------------------------- |
| 0 | `https://api.syllable.cloud` |

#### Example

```python
from syllable_sdk import SyllableSDK

syllable_sdk = SyllableSDK(api_key_header="YOUR_API_KEY", server_idx=0)

def run():
    result = syllable_sdk.agents.list()

    # Handle the result
    print(result)

run()

```

### Override Server URL Per-Client

The default server can also be overridden globally by passing a URL to the server_url parameter when initializing the SDK client instance. For example:

```python
from syllable_sdk import SyllableSDK

syllable_sdk = SyllableSDK(api_key_header="YOUR_API_KEY", server_url="http://localhost:8001")

def run():
    result = syllable_sdk.agents.list()

    # Handle the result
    print(result)

run()
```

## Authentication

### Per-Client Security Schemes

This SDK supports the following security scheme globally:

| Name           | Type   | Scheme  | Environment Variable         |
| -------------- | ------ | ------- | ---------------------------- |
| `api_key_header` | apiKey | API key | `SYLLABLESDK_API_KEY_HEADER` |

To authenticate with the API the `api_key_header` parameter must be set when initializing the SDK client instance. For example:

```python
from syllable_sdk import SyllableSDK
import os

syllable_sdk = SyllableSDK(
    api_key_header=os.getenv("SYLLABLESDK_API_KEY_HEADER", "")
)

def run():
    result = syllable_sdk.agents.list()

    # Handle the result
    print(result)

run()

```

# Development

## Maturity

This SDK is in beta, and there may be breaking changes between versions without a major version update. Therefore, we recommend pinning usage
to a specific package version. This way, you can install the same version each time without breaking changes unless you are intentionally
looking for the latest version.

## Contributions

While we value open-source contributions to this SDK, this library is generated programmatically. Any manual changes added to internal files will be overwritten on the next generation.
We look forward to hearing your feedback. Feel free to open a PR or an issue with a proof of concept and we'll do our best to include it in a future release.
